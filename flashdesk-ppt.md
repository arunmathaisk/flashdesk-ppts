# **Problem statement**

Designing an :
- intelligent
- on-demand
- prompt based
- UI/UX driven

containerized cloud platform for flexible and scalable deployment of virtual desktops and labs.

---

## **Objectives**

Develop an intelligent provisioning system that can:

1. Analyze user requirements and automatically select appropriate containerized cloud desktop configurations and lab setups based on their needs, optimizing resource utilization and performance.

2. Implement a user-friendly and intuitive UI that allows users to easily request, configure, and manage their on-demand cloud desktop environments and labs, minimizing the learning curve and enhancing the overall user experience.

---

## **Objectives (Contd.)**

3. Integrate advanced monitoring and analytics capabilities into the platform, enabling administrators to track usage patterns, resource consumption, and user behavior to make data-driven decisions for optimizing infrastructure and user satisfaction.

4. Design the platform to be highly scalable and elastic, capable of dynamically allocating resources based on demand fluctuations to ensure a seamless experience during peak usage periods and cost-efficiency during low demand.

---

## **Objectives (Contd.)**

5. Incorporate robust security measures, including user authentication, encryption, and access controls, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to cloud desktop environments and lab resources.

---

## **Scope**

1. Platform Architecture and Containerization:
   - Research and select suitable containerization technologies (e.g., Docker) and cloud infrastructure providers
	(e.g., AWS, Azure,OpenStack) to form the foundation of the platform.
   - Design the basic architecture of the platform, including the components for container orchestration and resource management.

---

## **Scope (Contd.)**

2. User Interface (UI) Development:
   - Develop a user-friendly web-based UI to enable users to request, configure, and manage their cloud desktop environments and lab setups.
   - Focus on essential features such as environment customization, lab selection, and status monitoring.

---

## **Scope (Contd.)**

3. Intelligent Provisioning System:
   - Implement a basic intelligent provisioning system that can analyze user input and suggest predefined configurations for cloud desktops and labs based on specified requirements.
   - Explore and integrate basic algorithms for automatic selection of appropriate resources and configurations.

---

## **Scope (Contd.)**

4. Core Functionality Implementation:
   - Create the backend functionality to instantiate containerized virtual desktops and lab environments based on user requests.
   - Enable basic scaling functionality to allocate resources dynamically according to user demand.

---

## **Scope (Contd.)**

5. Security and Authentication:
   - Incorporate essential security measures, such as user authentication and secure data transmission, to ensure the safety of user data and environments.
   - Implement basic access controls to prevent unauthorized access to resources.

---

## **Scope (Contd.)**

6. Monitoring and Analytics:
   - Set up basic monitoring and logging mechanisms to track usage patterns, resource consumption, and system performance.
   - Develop basic analytics features to provide insights on resource utilization and user behavior.

---

## **Scope (Contd.)**

7. Testing and Validation:
   - Perform rigorous testing of the platform to ensure its functionality, security, and performance under varying conditions.
   - Validate the platform against user requirements and obtain feedback for improvements.

---

## **Scope (Contd.)**

8. Documentation and Presentation:
   - Prepare comprehensive documentation covering system architecture, design decisions, implementation details, and usage instructions.
   - Present the project's progress and outcomes to faculty, peers, and stakeholders.
